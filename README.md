# pseudonymous_voting r3 tries online voting with a low degree of privacy

- Right during CoViD19 we have a general assembly.
- Many members wish to vote anonymously, even if a trused online voting system cannot exist

So we try a bad approximation of somewhat private online voting

## The system

- voters vote with token instead of name
- TP1 generates tokens and secretly hands each voters their token
  - The short tokens are released that everyone can verify the ony "registered voters" voted
- TP2 only sees the votes of the tokens (not names) and announces the result
  - The list with full tokens of active voters are send to TP1 for approval 
  - Each voter (except TP1) has the right to get a copy of a list of short-token + vote

The reason that only short-tokens are released is to prevent from a missuse of tokens even the short tokens are available to all for verification.
TP2 can only see the long-tokens from active voters. 

## Usage of the scripts

### as TP1

1. choose a direct channel where you can reach your voters (e-Mail / DM)
2. generate a single-column csv list of voters (e-Mail or DM-Handle) and name it ```data/input_r3_voters_emails.csv```
3. call ```python3 token_gen.py```
4. check output ```data/output_for_tp1_tokens_for_r3_voters.csv``` and ```data/output_for_tp2_r3_fulltokens_only.csv```
5. send ONLY ```data/output_for_tp2_r3_fulltokens_only.csv``` to TP2
6. use ```data/output_for_tp1_tokens_for_r3_voters.csv``` to send each voter their token
7. publish ```data/output_for_all_shorttokens_allowed_to_vote.csv``` to members

### as TP2

1. save ```data/output_for_tp2_r3_fulltokens_only.csv``` you got from TP1 in this directory
2. download voting results from nuudle via admin link and CSV and name it ```data/r3votenuudel.csv```
3. call ```data/python3 verify_vote_to_tokens.py```
4. publish results from nuudle and metainfo from script (number of invalid tokens)
5. publish ```data/output_for_all_shorttokens_that_voted.csv``` to members

### as Voter being part of TP1

1. vote at Nuudel with own token

### as Voters not part of TP1

1. vote at Nuudel with own token
2. check if your token is part of short-token lists sent by TP1 and TP2
3. check if your token is part of short-tokens in result
4. check if unknown tokens appear in list(+screenshot) sent by TP2

## The ideas behind the system

### Base assumptions

- TP1 has a direct channel to reach each individual voter
- TP2 has a broadcast channel to reach every voter BUT TP1
  - (m1ch): List gets only distriputed on request, if a voting result is doubted 

- TP1 and TP2 don't cooperate
- All voters will keep screenshot secret from TP1
- TP1 are trustworthy and check each other
- TP2 are several trustworthy people that check each other
- voters are not incompetent
- nuudle is useable and hidden votes are supported
- tokens can be sent privately
- nuudle does not care which voters connect's to it and keeps origin-ip of voter secret

- nobody knows who is which token (except TP1)
  - TP1 will never see the nuudle result

- TP2 do not who which token is who so are inclined to treat all votes equally
- TP2 don't invent results
  - (m1ch): If a result is doubted everyone can check their vote

### Attacks and Checks

- Someone can vote with token not generated by TP1
  - TP1 + TP2 delete votes with unknown tokens / full names
  - TP2 publish list of short-tokens that voted
  - voters can compare short-list of TP1 and TP2
- Someone can generate all possible full-token values from a short-token and spam the vote.
  - it's impossible to filter out the spam values from the one valid vote
  - whole process needs to be repeated
- Someone can toke a short-token from list from TP1 and vote for another person
  - that's why the full-token is secret and only full-tokens may vote
- TP1 could generate more tokens than voters and vote multiple times themselves
  - TP2s need to count number of tokens
  - voters need to check if their token is in list of short-tokens published by TP1 AND published by TP2
- TP1 could forget to send some people their tokens
  - voters need to complain if they did not get a token
  - TP2 must not start vote before everybody got a token
- TP2 could invent result instead of counting and announce invention
  - TP2 need to be trustworthy people with different agendas and check each other
  - possibly publish screenshot of admin-visible result to everyone BUT TP1, with the last part of the token painted over.
    - so every voter can check they were counted and that announced result still matches screenshot
- TP2 could still make everything up
  - that's why they are called "Trusted Persons" - if they make shit up, we trust them to do a good job
- voter can vote in multiple columns where only single choice is allowed
  - --> classic invalid vote which is not counted
- random person votes with someones or own nickname or unknown token
  - --> TP2 don't count that vote
- TP2 could ignore TP1's votes and falsify shit
  - yes that can happen, since TP1 can't check the result even less than everybody else
